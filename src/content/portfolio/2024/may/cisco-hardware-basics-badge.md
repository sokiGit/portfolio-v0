I decided it was time to add some more solid and verifiable achievements to my portfolio. Since I couldn't find my certificate for completing the CISCO IT Essentials course from my first year anywhere, I decided to take another one that was free on CISCO. I chose the Computer Hardware Basics course because it was free, short, and didn't require an instructor. It took me less than an evening to complete the entire course, and on my first attempt at the final test, I scored ~95% on computer hardware and about 75% on mobile device hardware, which also includes wearable devices, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even VR and AR. On my second attempt, I scored 100%. 


In the near future, I plan to add more certificates and badges from various free courses so that I have more proof of what I can really do.
