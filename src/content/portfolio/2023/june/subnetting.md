# Subnetting

I never thought I could actually learn something useful from a school assignment, but that attitude changed very recently. Thanks to a presentation for my operating systems class, I learned some fascinating information and gained valuable new skills in the world of network administration. I'd even go so far as to say that this is a much more effective way of learning specialized subjects than a typical lecture. It's even better when you can try things out for yourself while the teacher explains them. I was already fascinated by computer networks, but now I know for sure that this is the path I want to pursue.

My subnetting skills were then expanded a year later in our computer networks class, where we learned to calculate subnets, IP addresses, subnet masks, occupancy, etc.
