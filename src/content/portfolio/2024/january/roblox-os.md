# My Own Operating System in Roblox

On January 28th, out of pure boredom, I dove into an interesting project: creating a replica of a desktop environment directly in Roblox. Thanks to my experience with UI design, I had the visual part finished in no time. This inspired me to go further and begin programming a small, but pretty functional, operating system.

I added a number of features to it right away. The system now *supports* multiple desktops, and the time displayed on the desktop is synchronized with the time on the user's computer. Files and executables can be placed on the desktop, programs can be launched from them, and the programs windows' icons will appear in the taskbar. Each window can be moved, maximized to full screen and back, or hidden or deleted.

As a next challenge, I decided to implement my own internet browser. Surprisingly, it was easy to get a search function working and display the source code of a webpage to the client. However, the harder challenge was converting this text into the graphical interface of the Roblox engine. Even so, I was looking forward to this challenge and was happy to tackle it. Eventually I was able to correctly identify most important HTML elements and display them accordingly. CSS and JS wasn't implemented and I have implemented my own layout and styling rules to make it easier to navigate in Roblox.

Linux distributions, which allow for complete personalization, have been a major inspiration for me. The same motivation drives me in the development of this systemâ€”I want to create a platform where everyone can set everything up exactly to their liking.
